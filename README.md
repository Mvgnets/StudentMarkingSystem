# StudentMarkingSystem

This project saw the creation of a student marks system that stores student names, IDâ€™s, the modules that they are studying and their respective marks for each module. New students can be added, as well as new marks for existing students. A variety of statistics options are also available to view the average mark and passes/fails for each student, as well as the average mark and passes/fails for each module.
